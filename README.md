# Promocode campaign

A french taxicab company launched a marketing campaign in May 2017. It consisted in releasing a promocode that boosted the loyalty points accumulated during the campaign. This campaign is not intended to acquire new users, but rather activate the existing ones.The promocodes were emailed to company's users, so only existing users should have knowledge of it.

To be eligibile to Promocode, a user must satisfy 3 criteria:
- The ride is during Promocode event (May, 17-21th).
- The user claimed the promocode by entering it in the app.
- The user gained loyalty points during the ride.

The eligible rides may give up to 5 times the usual amount of points earned during the rides. The bonus points were credited with an adhoc script after the end of the campaign (the additional points cannot be seen in the dataset).

The data studied in this project contains a random subset of the rides from beginning of March to the end of May. There are 2 datasets to study in this project:
- events.csv used to store promotion and discount events.
- rides.csv stores information about the rides and users.
For a full description of the datasets, please visit the data folder.

In this projetct, I am going to study and analyse the data collected during Promocode. In particular, I will determine if this marketing campaign was successful. Following this, a startegy will be elaborated to make this campaign profitable for the campany and beneficial for the users at the same time.
